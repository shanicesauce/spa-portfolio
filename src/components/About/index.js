        I completed the UTSA Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp in December
        2022. My portfolio is a taste of what I have learned from this program
        and I hope you enjoy. I enjoy my leasure time by reading, connecting
        with nature, listening to various genres of music (I am proud that
        Beyonce was my top spotify artist last year.) and I enjoy traveling
        although I have only been to Vegas, various Texas cities and Nairobi &
        Mombasa,Kenya, I hope to traveling more in the future.Please contact me
        if you have any questions
